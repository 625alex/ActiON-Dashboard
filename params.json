Go to Dashboard of SmartThings Mobile app\r\n* Tap (+) on the bottom of the app\r\n* Swipe all the way to the right to My Apps\r\n* Pick the app that you created\r\n* Follow through SmartApp preferences and copy the dashboard URL\r\n* Don't forget to click \"Done\"\r\n\r\nInstall app via SmartThings IDE (no longer supported)\r\n======\r\n\r\n1.

Click \"Next\" button finally click \"Done\".\r\n* Dashboard URL is printed in the logs\r\n\r\nPlease not that I no longer support this feature. Installing via the IDE works, but people will have to figure it out on their own.\r\n\r\nAndroid and iOS native apps\r\n=====\r\nTo install Action Dashboard as a native app, open the URL in Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android device, then add shortcut to the home screen. When the shortcut icon is tapped, the dashboard launches as a full screen native application (without toolbars).\r\n\r\nOAuth\r\n=====\r\n* If you don’t want to expose the access_token, you can omit it from the URL. You will be prompted to login with your SmartThings account.\r\n* If you need to invalidate the access_token, you can reset it via the SmartApp preferences, uninstall the SmartApp or change OAuth details in the App Settings (IDE).\r\n\r\nDropcam Stream\r\n=====\r\nIn order to display a Dropcam stream, your camera must be public. This is the only way to display a Dropcam stream. This only works on Desktop browsers since Dropcam requires Flash.\r\n\r\n1. Login into your Dropcam account and select the camera that you want to add to the dashboard. Click on Sharing > Public. Click on \"Make Public\" button.\r\n* Copy content of \"Embed Video\" box to a text editor.\r\n* Inside the block of code there will be a URL that looks like \r\nhttps://www.dropcam.com/e/1234abcd?autoplay=true\r\n* Copy this URL into your SmartApp.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n=====\r\nIf you encountering errors during installation you either\r\n-\tYou didn’t enable OAuth when you installed the app in the IDE (see above).\r\n-\tYou tried to install via the IDE and clicked \"Install\" rather than \"Done\" (see above).\r\n-\tYou are upgrading from version 3 and you didn’t step through app preferences.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these is applicable, please contact the developer.\r\n\r\nTips and tricks\r\n=====\r\n*\tIf you think your tiles are too small/big you can try to change this from the default target size of 120px. To do that, add \"&t=120\" at the end of your dashboard's URL and play with the value to see what works best for you. If you are using a desktop browser you can also use zoom in/out.\r\n*\tThere were feature requests for one switch control a group of switches.\r\n *\tThis can be achieved with Big Switch app by ST. You can find it on your mobile app. Tap (+) > More > Convenience > Scroll to the bottom and find \"The Big Switch\" app. Then setup the master and slave switches.\r\n *\tIf you want to create a virtual (master) switches, go to IDE > My Devices > New Device. Enter required fields and choose \"On/Off Button Tile\" in the type election box. Then you can use it as any other switch and put it on the dashboard.\r\n*\tIf you want multiple instances of the dashboard, install SmartApp only once in the IDE. Then, create as many instances as necessary in the ST Mobile App. Each instance has its own set of preferences.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
